# This file defines a sequence of robot movements and actions
# It specifies poses and a set of targets for robot motion

Poses:
  # Pose 1: Starting/home position - where the robot begins
  pose1:
    x: 0.2
    y: 0
    z: 0.5
    roll: 3.14
    pitch: 0
    yaw: 0
 
  # Pose 2: Intermediate position
  pose2:
    x: 0.417
    y: 0.094
    z: 0.280
    roll: 3.14
    pitch: 0
    yaw: 0
  
  # Pose 3: Another movement target
  pose3:
    x: 0.421
    y: 0.010
    z: 0.280
    roll: 3.14
    pitch: 0
    yaw: 0

# Targets define the sequence of movements the robot will follow
# Each step moves the robot to a predefined pose

targets:
  - move2pose: pose1  # Move to starting position
  - move2pose: pose2  # Move to intermediate position
  - move2pose: pose3  # Move to final target position
