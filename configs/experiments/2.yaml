# This file defines a sequence of robot movements and actions
# It specifies poses and a set of targets for robot motion
# Each pose has x, y, z coordinates in centimeters and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians

Poses:
  # Pose 1: Starting/home position - where the robot begins
  pose1:
    x: 20
    y: 0
    z: 50
    roll: 3.14
    pitch: 0
    yaw: 0
 
  # Pose 2: Intermediate position
  pose2:
    x: 41.7
    y: 09.4
    z: 28.0
    roll: 3.14
    pitch: 0
    yaw: 0
  
  # Pose 3: Another movement target
  pose3:
    x: 42.1
    y: 01.0
    z: 28.0
    roll: 3.14
    pitch: 0
    yaw: 0

# Targets define the sequence of movements the robot will follow
# Each step moves the robot to a predefined pose

targets:
  - Move: pose1  # Move to starting position
  - Move: pose2  # Move to intermediate position
  - Move: pose3  # Move to final target position
