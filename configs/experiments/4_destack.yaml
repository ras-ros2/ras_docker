# This file defines a sequence of robot movements and actions for de-stacking objects
# This file performs the reverse operation of the stacking experiment.

# Poses section defines all the positions the robot can move to

# Each pose has x, y, z coordinates in centimeters and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians

# - out1: Starting/ending position
# - above*: Positions above each location (for approach)
# - in*: Positions at each location (for picking/placing)

Poses:
  # Starting/home position - where the robot begins and ends
  out1: {x: 20, y: 0, z: 50, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # First object location (topmost object in the stack)
  above1: {x: 41.7, y: 9.4, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in1: {x: 41.7, y: 9.4, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Second object location (middle object in the stack)
  above2: {x: 42.1, y: 1.0, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in2: {x: 42.1, y: 1.0, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Third object location (bottom-most object in the stack)
  above3: {x: 42.3, y: -6.4, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in3: {x: 42.3, y: -6.4, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Fourth location positions (where the first object was placed originally)
  above4: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in4: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Fifth location positions (where the second object was placed originally)
  above5: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in5: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 20.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Sixth location positions (where the third object was placed originally)
  above6: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in6: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 22.6, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
# Targets section defines the sequence of actions the robot will perform for de-stacking
# Each operation follows the pattern:
# 1. Move to starting position (out1)
# 2. Move above stacked object
# 3. Move to stacked object
# 4. Close gripper (true)
# 5. Move to previous above location
# 6. Move above original location
# 7. Move to original location
# 8. Open gripper (false)
# 9. Move to previous above location

targets:
  # starting position
  - move2pose: out1

  # Operation 1: Move object from position 6 to position 3 (topmost object)
  - move2pose: above6
  - move2pose: in6
  - gripper: true
  - move2pose: above6
  - move2pose: above3
  - move2pose: in3
  - gripper: false
  - move2pose: above3

  # Operation 2: Move object from position 5 to position 2 (middle object)
  - move2pose: above5
  - move2pose: in5
  - gripper: true
  - move2pose: above5
  - move2pose: above2
  - move2pose: in2
  - gripper: false
  - move2pose: above2

  # Operation 3: Move object from position 4 to position 1 (bottom-most object)
  - move2pose: above4
  - move2pose: in4
  - gripper: true
  - move2pose: above4
  - move2pose: above1
  - move2pose: in1
  - gripper: false
  - move2pose: above1

  # Return to starting position
  - move2pose: out1
