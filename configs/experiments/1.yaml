# This file defines a sequence of robot movements and actions for picking and placing objects

# Poses section defines all the positions the robot can move to
# Each pose has x, y, z coordinates in centimeters and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians

Poses:
  # Starting/home position - where the robot begins and ends
  home: {x: 20, y: 0, z: 50, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # First object location
  above1: {x: 20, y: -35, z: 33, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: -1.575}  # Approach position
  in1: {x: 20, y: -35, z: 25, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: -1.575}     # Picking position
  
  # Second object location
  out2: {x: 20, y: 0, z: 50, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: -1.575}  # Transition position
  above2: {x: 40, y: 0, z: 37, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: -1.575}  # Approach position
  in2: {x: 40, y: 0, z: 33, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: -1.575}     # Placing position
  
  # Third object location
  out3: {x: 20, y: -12, z: 33, roll: 0, pitch: 1.57, yaw: 0}  # Transition position
  front3: {x: 16, y: -14, z: 16, roll: 0, pitch: 1.57, yaw: 0}  # Approach position
  in3: {x: 28, y: -14, z: 16, roll: 0, pitch: 1.57, yaw: 0}     # Picking position
  
  # Fourth movement positions
  up4: {x: 28, y: -14, z: 27, roll: 0, pitch: 1.57, yaw: 0}  # Move up
  left4: {x: 28, y: -06, z: 28, roll: 0, pitch: 1.57, yaw: 0}  # Move left
  
  # Fifth movement positions
  above5: {x: 28, y: -11, z: 45, roll: 0, pitch: 1.57, yaw: 0}  # Approach position
  out5: {x: 0, y: 40, z: 30, roll: 0, pitch: 1.57, yaw: 0}  # Final placing position

# Targets section defines the sequence of actions the robot will perform
# Each operation follows the pattern:
# 1. Move to home position
# 2. Move above object location
# 3. Move to object location (Pick)
# 4. Move to the next position (Place)
# 5. Move back to transition position

targets:
  # Move to starting position
  - Move: home
  
  # Operation 1: Pick from position 1 and move to position 2
  - Move: above1
  - Pick: in1
  - Move: out2
  - Move: above2
  - Place: in2
  - Move: out2
  
  # Operation 2: Pick from position 3 and move to position 4
  - Move: out3
  - Move: front3
  - Pick: in3
  - Move: up4
  - Move: left4
  
  # Rotation actions
  - rotate: -1.57
  - rotate: 1.57
  
  # Operation 3: Move to final position
  - Move: above5
  - Place: out5
