# This file defines a sequence of robot movements and actions
# It specifies poses and a set of targets for robot motion
# Each pose has x, y, z coordinates in centimeters and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians

# Targets define the sequence of movements and actions the robot will follow

targets:
