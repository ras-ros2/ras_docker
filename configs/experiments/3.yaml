# Targets define the sequence of movements and actions the robot will follow

targets:
  - Move: home  # Move to initial position
  - Move: above1  # Move above first pickup location
  - Pick: in1  # Reach into first pickup location and pick
  - Move: out2  # Transition to drop-off area
  - Move: above2  # Hover above drop-off location
  - Place: in2  # Reach into drop-off area
  - Move: above2  # Move above drop-off location
  - Move: out2  # Transition to next movement
  - Move: out3  # Move to new intermediate position
  - Move: front3  # Approach next pickup point
  - Pick: in3  # Reach into pickup point
  - Move: up4  # Lift object
  - Move: left4  # Move left
  - rotate: -1.57  # Rotate counterclockwise
  - rotate: 1.57  # Rotate back clockwise
  - Move: above5  # Move above final drop-off
  - Place: out5  # Move to final position
