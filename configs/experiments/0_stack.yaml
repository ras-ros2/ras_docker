# This file defines a sequence of robot movements and actions for picking and placing objects
# This file performs a single stack of 3 blocks.

# Poses section defines all the positions the robot can move to

# Each pose has x, y, z coordinates in centimeters and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians

# - home: Starting/ending position
# - above*: Positions above each location (for approach)
# - in*: Positions at each location (for picking/placing)

Poses:
  # Starting/home position - where the robot begins and ends
  home: {x: 20.0, y: 0, z: 50.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # First object location
  above1: {x: 41.7, y: 9.4, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in1: {x: 41.7, y: 9.4, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Second object location
  above2: {x: 42.1, y: 1.0, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in2: {x: 42.1, y: 1.0, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Third object location
  above3: {x: 42.3, y: -6.4, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in3: {x: 42.3, y: -6.4, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Fourth location positions (for placing first object)
  above4: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in4: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 17.4, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Fifth location positions (for stacking - first level, for placing second object)
  above5: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in5: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 20.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
  # Sixth location positions (for stacking - second level, for placing third object)
  above6: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 28.0, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  in6: {x: 33.7, y: -7.6, z: 22.6, roll: 3.14, pitch: 0, yaw: 0}
  
# Targets section defines the sequence of actions the robot will perform
# Each operation follows the pattern:
# 1. Move to home position
# 2. Move above object location (above1)
# 3. Pick at object location (in1)
# 4. Move to destination (above4)
# 5. Place at destination (in4)
# 6. Repeat steps for different poses
# 7. Move back to home position

targets:
  # starting position
  - Move: home

  # Operation 1: Move object from position 1 to position 4
  - Move: above1
  - Pick: in1
  - Move: above4
  - Place: in4

  # Operation 2: Move object from position 2 to position 5 (first stack)
  - Move: above2
  - Pick: in2
  - Move: above5
  - Place: in5

  # Operation 3: Move object from position 3 to position 6 (second stack)
  - Move: above3
  - Pick: in3
  - Move: above6
  - Place: in6

  # Return to starting position
  - Move: home
